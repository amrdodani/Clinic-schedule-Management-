By hiring green, Congress set up a way of working with other agencies like the Forest Service and the IRS that will improve the quality of its records.\n\nThe State Department also serves the needliest and poorest part of America by keeping records about how they spend taxpayer dollars (which can be used to finance infrastructure projects).\n\n\"Every time we lose a record, or we start to lose other departments or departments, we do everything possible to help"}
